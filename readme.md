# üß† Quantitative Research & Credit Risk Modeling  
**JPMorgan Chase & Co. Forage Virtual Experience Program**

This repository contains solutions to tasks from the Quantitative Research virtual internship at JPMorgan Chase & Co., hosted on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). The focus is on applying quantitative methods to real-world financial data ‚Äî including credit risk modeling, time-series forecasting, and optimization.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `ProbabilityOfDefault.ipynb` ‚Äì Estimate loan default probability using logistic regression and performance metrics (AUC, F1, Gini).
- `refactoredSolution.ipynb` ‚Äì Build a dynamic contract pricing system using Prophet and interpolation for natural gas prices.
- `Quantization.ipynb` ‚Äì Apply dynamic programming and log-likelihood optimization to convert FICO scores into rating buckets.
- `GasPredictionProphet.ipynb` ‚Äì Time-series forecast of natural gas prices and visualizations for downstream prediction.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Task 1 ‚Äì Probability of Default (Credit Risk)
Built a classifier to estimate a borrower's default probability using logistic regression and evaluation metrics.  
Used cost-benefit analysis to estimate savings of up to **$2.16M/year** by rejecting top 20% high-risk loans.

### Task 2 ‚Äì Contract Pricing with Forecasts
Forecasted natural gas prices with Prophet and created a price lookup model using linear interpolation.  
Used to automate energy contract pricing and reduce forecasting error across **1000+ monthly quotes**.

### Task 4 ‚Äì FICO Score Quantization (Dynamic Programming)
Optimized FICO score segmentation using log-likelihood-based dynamic programming.  
Created 5 credit rating buckets to drive fair, explainable risk scoring based on historical defaults.

### Task 5 ‚Äì On-Demand Price Estimation
Built a lightweight interface to predict gas prices for any given date using forecast interpolation.  
Enabled **real-time quoting tools** for volatile commodity markets, reducing manual lookup time.
