    "# Scenario\n",
    "- A gas trading client wants to store natural gas during the summer and sell it in winter, expecting higher seasonal prices due to a colder-than-average forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# My Task\n",
    "- Build a prototype pricing model that calculates the net value of such storage contracts using forecasted natural gas prices and key cost inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Business Value\n",
    "- This model helps the trading desk quickly estimate potential profit/loss from seasonal trades, guiding client negotiations and supporting automated quoting in future.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explanation\n",
    "- The model forecasts future prices using Prophet, calculates buy/sell values for chosen injection/withdrawal dates, deducts storage and operational costs, and outputs the net contract values."
